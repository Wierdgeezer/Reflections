What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initialising a Repository creates a new .git directory at the bottom of your project directory. This is needed by git to record any changes to files throughout my project's lifecycle.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
	The staging area does not hold complete files as the working directory does, nor does it record the files differences between versions as the repository does. It records the files names for as scratchpad entries prior to being added to the repository.

What value do you think it offers?
	It allows the files to be selected provisionally before being commited for logging within the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	The staging area allows you to add only those files you know are associated with a single logical change. Any others can be added after one logical change hasbeen committed. If you have made more than one logical change in the course of a file's development between commits you should ensure the commit notes show this. However you should avoid this and keep to one logical change per commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	You may want to make experimental changes to a program or develop an upgrade whilst keeping the current versions development safe. You may want to start a parallel project - same but with a different language or platform. Labelling the branches will allow you to select a branch easily to commence work without changing other branches.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
