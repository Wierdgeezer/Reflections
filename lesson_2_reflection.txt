What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initialising a Repository creates a new .git directory at the bottom of your project directory. This is needed by git to record any changes to files throughout my project's lifecycle.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
	The staging area does not hold complete files as the working directory does, nor does it record the files differences between versions as the repository does. It records the files names for as scratchpad entries prior to being added to the repository.
What value do you think it offers?
	It allows the files to be selected provisionally before being commited for logging within the repository.
